# The-Kevin-Bacon-Game
Find how removed certain actors are from Kevin Bacon!

All methods can be accessed after the IMBD file has been chosen. The methods are listed in a menu, and then an input is asked to be taken from the command line to choose a method.

findall() will print out all of the paths to the Center for every single actor and actress in the database.

most() lists the actor with the highest degree, or the actor with the most film credits.

longest() prints out the longest or one of the longest paths to the Center, or one of the actors or actresses with the largest Bacon Numbers.

movies(name) lists all of the outbound edges from a given name.

All of the provided IMBD urls have been stored in the program itself, and if an invalid file is entered into the command line, the program will let the user know that the file doesn't exist.

Since Kevin Bacon is not in the pre1950 database, the default center is randomly calculated for this file.
